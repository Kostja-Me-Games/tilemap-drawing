## Beginning:

Just tiles on tilemap, no drawing.

## Fixed painting with mouse with selected tile brush

Turns out I have duplicated tilemaps and i was painting on a tilemap under another full of tiles.

Also made sure that we are not painting with tile brush if we have a building selected.

## Panel to avoid painting when clicking buttons

Problem: mouse click on buttons still caused tile paint. So i made a panel, added tracking of mouse over panel and
didn't allow drawing if mouse over panel.
